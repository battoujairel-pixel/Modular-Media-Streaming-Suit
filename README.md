Modular Media Streaming Suite — Java Demo

The Modular Media Streaming Suite is a Java-based demo project that illustrates how structural design patterns can be combined to build a flexible, modular media playback system.

Rather than focusing on real audio or video output, the suite uses console-based playback simulation to clearly demonstrate the architecture, extensibility, and maintainability of a well-designed media player.

 Structural Patterns in Action

The project showcases the use of multiple structural design patterns, each addressing a specific aspect of flexibility and scalability:

Bridge – Decouples the player’s core logic from rendering implementations (e.g., hardware vs. software rendering).

Adapter – Allows legacy or incompatible media formats to be integrated with the new playback system.

Decorator – Adds runtime enhancements such as watermark overlays or equalizer settings without changing the player’s base code.

Composite – Provides hierarchical playlist management, supporting playlists within playlists for unified playback.

Proxy – Handles remote media caching, optimizing performance for repeated streaming sessions.

 Core Features

Playback support for local media, HLS streams, and remote API sources.

Creation of multi-level playlists through the Composite pattern.

Dynamic switching between hardware and software renderers.

Add-on features like audio equalization and visual watermarks via Decorators.

Proxy-based caching for faster replays of networked media.

Smooth integration of legacy streaming sources through the Adapter pattern.

System Requirements

Java 17+ (tested successfully on JDK 25)

A Java-compatible IDE such as Visual Studio Code (with the Java Extension Pack) or IntelliJ IDEA

 How to Run
Using Visual Studio Code

Open the project folder in VS Code.

Install the Java Extension Pack if prompted.

Open the file Demo.java.

Select the run configuration "Run Modular Media Suite" or press Ctrl + F5 to execute the demo.

Using the Command Line

Run the following from the project root:

mkdir -p out
javac -d out $(find src/main/java -name "*.java")
java -cp out com.example.media.Demo

 Overview

This demonstration highlights how structural patterns can transform a simple media player into a highly modular, easily extensible, and pattern-driven architecture.
It’s an excellent learning tool for developers exploring design patterns, object-oriented architecture, or framework-level media system design in Java.
